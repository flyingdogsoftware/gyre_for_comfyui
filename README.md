# Gyre for ComfyUI

This is an internal Preview. So no further information here for now. This will change soon.

# Installation

- Clone this repo into the custom nodes folder.

- Extensions are needed as well. Install is in a separate subfolder of the custom nodes folder https://github.com/flyingdogsoftware/gyre-extensions

- Restart ComfyUI server. At the server start, it checks for an update of the latest Gyre version and downloads it automatically. This can take a few minutes.
